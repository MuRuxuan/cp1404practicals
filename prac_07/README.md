## Key Lessons on Clean Code
Core takeaways about "clean code" from this course include:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function or class should have one clear purpose. For example, in the project management program, loading, saving, and displaying projects are handled by separate functions for easier maintenance.
- **Semantic Naming**: Names of variables and functions should be descriptive. For instance, use `guitar_collection` (instead of vague names like `data_list`) to represent a list of Guitar objects.
- **Consistent Formatting and Documentation**: Enforce consistent code formatting (indentation, line breaks, etc.) and add comments to classes/functions. For example, document the `__init__` and `__str__` methods of the `ProgrammingLanguage` class to clarify parameters and return values.
